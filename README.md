 INM363 Individual Project Code Final submission - Abhimanyu Acharya (200051341)

1.	Data
•	Download data from - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bxR6DB1GqIY8ny30RRQOPLj5-mxFPYMT
•	Unzip data save locally. Note the location. This will be used to populate the ‘datadir’ variable.

2.	Jupyter notebooks and supporting Code
•	Option 1: Unzip submitted folder with Jupyter notebooks and python files and save locally.
•	Option 2: Download Jupyter notebooks and supporting python files from -
      https://github.com/abhimanyuacharya/INM363_Individual-Project-Code_Abhimanyu-Acharya_200051341

•	On the top of every Jupyter notebook to run ZSL models change the ‘datadir’ variable to where you have saved the data. 

For running ZSL models
data_dir = 'C:/Dissertation/Data/'

For extracting Image features using Tensorflow
data_dir = 'C:\Dissertation\Data\AwA2-data\Animals_with_Attributes2\JPEGImages'

3.	Setting up python environment
•	Environment 1: For everything else (ZSL Models, Creating Knowledge Graphs, Extracting semantic embeddings)
o	Create a new python environment.
o	Install the required libraries using requirements_env1.txt submitted with additional information.

•	Environment 2: For extracting image features 
o	Create a new python environment.
o	Install the required libraries using requirements_env1.txt submitted with additional information.
o	Run the Extracting Image Features using CNN - RESNET101.ipynb Jupyter notebook.

4.	Running Jupyter notebooks for extracting OWL2Vec* embeddings
•	The required Jupyter notebooks are within the OWL2Vec-Star-master folder. 
•	Run the notebooks from within the folder and do not move them elsewhere.
